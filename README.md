# 🐸 Amphibians App

This is a simple Android application built with **Jetpack Compose** that fetches data from a remote API using **Retrofit** and displays it in a modern UI. The app demonstrates the usage of **Hilt for dependency injection**, **Gson for JSON parsing**, and **Coil for image loading**. It follows the **MVVM architecture** for clean code structure and better scalability.

## 🚀 Features

- Fetches animal data (e.g., name, type, description, and image) from a REST API.
- Converts JSON data to Kotlin objects using **GsonConverterFactory**.
- Loads images efficiently using **Coil**.
- Uses **Hilt** for clean dependency injection and avoiding memory leaks.
- Follows **modern Android MVVM architecture** using `ViewModel`, `StateFlow`, and `Composable` UIs.
